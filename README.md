# Find Your Hat
I completed this JavaScript program as part of the Codecademy Front-End Engineer career path. It is an interactive terminal game. The scenario is that the player has lost their hat in a field full of holes, and they must navigate back to it without falling down one of the holes or stepping outside the field.

To execute game, in the terminal, type node main.js.
